I’m a DevOps engineer with a strong interest in AWS, cloud architecture, and building systems that are both scalable and reliable. I’ve been working in the tech industry for over 11 years, mostly around infrastructure, automation, and helping teams run production systems with fewer surprises.

I enjoy tinkering with cloud infrastructure and serverless applications, especially when it involves understanding *how things break* and designing systems that fail more gracefully. Lately, I’ve been spending time exploring agentic workflows, generative AI, and how these tools can be applied to operational and DevOps problems in practical ways.

This site is where I write about things I’m experimenting with, lessons learned from building and operating systems, and ideas I find interesting in the cloud and DevOps space. Think of it as a mix of hands-on walkthroughs, small prototypes, and reflections from working with real-world infrastructure.

If any of that resonates with you, or if you’re building something similar, I’d be happy to connect.
