Hi, I’m Siddharth 👋

This site is where I write about things I’m exploring and building, mostly around:
- AWS and cloud architecture  
- DevOps and operational workflows  
- Automation, tooling, and reliability  
- Agentic systems and practical uses of generative AI in infrastructure  

The focus here is on **hands-on learning and practical experimentation**, not theory for its own sake.
